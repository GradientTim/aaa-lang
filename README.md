# AAA-Lang

**Because none of those other languages were good enough, clearly.**

Have you ever been bogged down by the mediocrity of, well, every single programming language ever created? We know we have. That's why we present to you AAA: the culmination of everything that's ever been awesome about programming, crammed haphazardly into a single, glorious syntax.

## Why AAA? Here's a list of features that don't really matter:

- **Syntax so intuitive, you'll forget how to write English.** (But seriously, it's like reading a toddler's fever dream.)
- **Readability? Who needs it? We have only A's!** (Because nothing says professional codebase like a sprinkling of poop emojis.)
- **A built-in coffee maker.** (Just kidding, that would be useful. This is AAA, remember?)

## Who is AAA for?

- Programmers who enjoy a good challenge (like deciphering ancient runes).
- Masochists.
- Anyone who misses the good old days of programming with punch cards.

## Getting Started

- Install AAA. (How? We haven't figured that part out yet.)
- Stare blankly at the documentation. (There is no documentation.)
- Try to write a simple "Hello, World!" program. (Good luck. You'll need it.)
- Abandon all hope. (We warned you this was a sarcasm project.)

## We recommend using AAA for:

Writing code that will confuse future generations of programmers.
Wasting valuable company time and resources.
Impressing nobody with your questionable taste in programming languages.
But hey, if you're into that sort of thing, be our guest.
