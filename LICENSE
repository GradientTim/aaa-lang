The AAA license

YOU ARE NOT PERMITTED TO (but seriously, who cares?):

- Use AAA for anything remotely productive. This is a sarcasm project, remember?
- Hold the creators liable for any mental breakdowns, soul-crushing confusion, or existential dread caused by using AAA. You were warned.
- Expect even a modicum of support. We barely understand this code ourselves.
- Try to claim AAA as your own work. It's about as original as a lukewarm cup of coffee (and probably less useful).

YOU ARE (sort of) ALLOWED TO (with our begrudging blessing):

- Play around with AAA at your own peril. We're not responsible for any lost brain cells.
- Mock AAA to your heart's content. It probably deserves it.
- Fork this project and make it even worse. Challenge accepted?
- Spread the word about AAA, but only to warn others of its questionable existence.
- Basically, do whatever you want with AAA. We don't really care. (Except maybe secretly hoping you'll find a way to make it useful. But that's just silly, right?)
